    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

any add-ons that generate XML data or perform filtering."
One might question what "Western European" includes.
Resolution or Recommendation:
It appears that ECM 3.5 with Internet Explorer 11 can be run on Windows 7 FR.
If you need the IE configuration settings in English you can use the following commands: (this technique may
also be helpful in comparing one operational IE configuration against another)

2025-06-05 13:05:19,555 - INFO - Message 1 - Role: system
2025-06-05 13:05:19,555 - INFO - Content: ### Task:

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

General Description/Summary:
The Agilent OpenLAB ECM Software and Hardware Requirements document states that the ECM client
requires the following OS:
"English US or Western European. English US is recommended for client machines running Schedulers or
any add-ons that generate XML data or perform filtering."
One might question what "Western European" includes.
Resolution or Recommendation:
It appears that ECM 3.5 with Internet Explorer 11 can be run on Windows 7 FR.
If you need the IE configuration settings in English you can use the following commands: (this technique may
also be helpful in comparing one operational IE configuration against another)
Registry keys for IE exported to capture configuration:? from elevated command prompt

- Elle sera déplacée vers une nouvelle section appelée "Voir les Factures Détachées", accessible sous l'onglet Facturation du core facility.
- Elle pourra également être consultée via le lien "Factures", trouvé dans le menu de navigation à gauche sous Core Facilities.
- Les factures détachées sont facilement identifiables grâce au statut marqué en rouge "Détaché".
- Un filtre est disponible dans le panneau des filtres des Factures pour rechercher spécifiquement les factures détachées.

Enfin, lors du prochain événement de facturation créé, les factures détachées seront automatiquement incluses si vous cochez leur case ou utilisez l'option d'inclusion automatique [1].

1. **Navigate to the Billing Tab:**
   - Go to the core's Billing tab where you can view your list of existing billing events.

2. **Select the Appropriate Billing Event:**
   - Find a billing event with a status of either "Billing Initialized" or "Draft" that contains the invoice(s) you wish to detach.

3. **Open the Invoice:**
   - Click on the appropriate invoice link to display a list of all invoices associated with that billing event.
   - Open the specific invoice you want to detach by selecting the magnifying glass icon located on the far right.

4. **Detach Invoice:**
   - Once the invoice is open, select the "Detach Invoice" icon at the top of the invoice page.
   - The Detach Invoice window will appear. You may enter a note in the provided field if desired, but it is not required.

5. **Confirm Detachment:**
   - Click "Detach invoice." This action will remove the invoice from this billing event.
   - A note indicating that the invoice has been detached will now be displayed at the top of this invoice [1][3].

Please ensure that none of these conditions apply before detaching an invoice:
- The invoice has been marked as Paid or Partially Paid.
- The billing event has a status of File Sent, meaning all invoices have already been sent for final processing [3].

It wears a cloak woven from moments, each thread shimmering with memories both cherished and forgotten. Its eyes are the color of twilight, seeing everything yet revealing nothing. Time speaks in whispers, carried by the wind, as it caresses the leaves and kisses the waves.

This enigmatic being walks silently across endless plains of existence, leaving footprints that fade but never truly disappear. In its wake bloom gardens of nostalgia, where past joys and sorrows blossom anew under its gentle gaze.

Time is both friend and foe—a relentless teacher who demands we learn from every heartbeat while stealing each precious second away. It wields power over all things transient yet bows to eternity's throne.

With fingers like tendrils of mist, Time touches all that lives; it writes stories in stardust and seals them within infinity’s embrace. A chameleon at heart—changing form to suit perception—it can be swift as lightning or slow as honeyed amber dripping languidly from nature’s spoon.

To dance with Time is to engage in life’s grand ballet: ever-changing partners twirl upon reality’s stage until final curtain falls—when even Time must pause… if only for an instant before continuing on its ceaseless journey through forevermore.

It moves with a rhythm all its own, sometimes rushing forward like a river in flood, at other times meandering slowly like a lazy stream under the summer sun. Yet always it remains elusive, slipping through grasping fingers like sand in an hourglass.

Time is both creator and destroyer—a relentless force that builds empires only to watch them crumble back into dust. It nurtures growth while eroding mountains; it heals wounds even as it deepens others.

In this dance between seconds and centuries, time remains ever vigilant—a guardian of change and constancy alike. And though we may try to measure or control it with clocks and calendars, ultimately we are but passengers on its eternal journey—a journey without beginning or end.

In a client/server environment, you take the HOSTNAME of the computer running the 'shared\nservices' and provide that to the CDS so it knows where to go for a license and the 'Instrument Controller.'?In\na workstation environment, CDS launches thusly:?1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument\ncontroller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey network, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?2. The network\nreplies 'You, silly. You ARE <OriginalName>!'.?3. CDS says, 'Ahh yes, I see that - I have found the license\nserver at <OriginalName> and I will launch.'?TYPICAL PROBLEM/SCENARIO:?Problems arise, however,\nwhen the computer HOSTNAME is changed AFTER OpenLAB had been installed. When the HOSTNAME is\nchanged (perhaps by the customer's IT department), the shared services entry in the CDS does not. So the\nCDS has no idea that it needs to go somewhere else to find the required servers. The conversation is\nthus:?1. I am configured to find the license server and instrument controller at host <OriginalName>. 'Hey\nnetwork, what is the IP address of <OriginalName>?'?2. The network replies 'I have no idea what\n<OriginalName> is, that host does not exist on the network.'?3. CDS says, 'Dang, well I guess I can't start\nthen because my license server and instrument controller are missing. Woe is me.'?SYMPTOMS:C.01.05\nexhibits TWO classic symptoms whenever the Instrument Controller and License Server cannot be\nresolved:?1. The OpenLAB Control Panel becomes unresponsive.

of the service requests submitted by the members exceeds the auto-approval threshold (for more

information see Request Services ). You can adjust your lab threshold in the Lab-wide Approval

Settings section: Default notification threshold for reservations: An email notification is sent to the

lab s financial administrators each time the cost of a lab member s reservation exceeds the set

threshold. The notification is triggered based on the total cost, of the reservation combining

scheduled time and any add-on charges. The default threshold is set to $1000. Default

approved. In the example above, a service request can have a price of up to $500 to receive

auto-approval. Cost overage buffer: The amount that a service request can go over the original

service request cost can exceed up to $100 of the initial price before requiring financial

re-approval. Manage Memberships The Lab Members and Settings section allows you to

add/remove members from the group and manage the existing memberships. Member icons:

Set Approval Thresholds Financial approvals are required from lab administrators when the cost

of the service requests submitted by the members exceeds the auto-approval threshold (for more

information see Request Services ). You can adjust your lab threshold in the Lab-wide Approval

Settings section: Default notification threshold for reservations: An email notification is sent to the

lab s financial administrators each time the cost of a lab member s reservation exceeds the set

threshold. The notification is triggered based on the total cost, of the reservation combining

scheduled time and any add-on charges. The default threshold is set to $1000. Default

auto-approve threshold: The maximum cost of a service request that can be automatically

approved. In the example above, a service request can have a price of up to $500 to receive

auto-approval. Cost overage buffer: The amount that a service request can go over the original

agreed-upon cost before a notification is sent to the lab administrators. In the example above, a

service request cost can exceed up to $100 of the initial price before requiring financial

re-approval. Manage Memberships The Lab Members and Settings section allows you to

add/remove members from the group and manage the existing memberships. Member icons:

Role (person icon): Hover your mouse over this icon to display the role of the user. When blue,

this icon is identifying PIs and Members. The yellow version of the icon will represent Lab

associated with the lab until the start date. Used to set up lab members in advance, without giving

them access until their start date. When left empty, the user will be active immediately. End Date:

The end date for the user as a member of the lab. After that, the user will be removed from the

lab and will not be allowed to pay for services using any lab fund. When left empty, the

membership will have an indefinite duration. Note: For expired users, outstanding charges will still

Set Approval Thresholds Financial approvals are required from lab administrators when the cost

of the service requests submitted by the members exceeds the auto-approval threshold (for more

information see Request Services ). You can adjust your lab threshold in the Lab-wide Approval

Settings section: Default notification threshold for reservations: An email notification is sent to the

lab s financial administrators each time the cost of a lab member s reservation exceeds the set

threshold. The notification is triggered based on the total cost, of the reservation combining

scheduled time and any add-on charges. The default threshold is set to $1000. Default

auto-approve threshold: The maximum cost of a service request that can be automatically

approved. In the example above, a service request can have a price of up to $500 to receive

auto-approval. Cost overage buffer: The amount that a service request can go over the original

agreed-upon cost before a notification is sent to the lab administrators. In the example above, a

service request cost can exceed up to $100 of the initial price before requiring financial

re-approval. Manage Memberships The Lab Members and Settings section allows you to

About this topic

This topic describes how to create a plate group, which is a list of specific 
labware that can be moved into or out of a labware storage device without 
regard for which slots they are stored in.

Read this topic if your lab automation system has an incubator or random-
access storage device, such as the Labware MiniHub.

KB0911171326
ECM 3.5
General Description/Summary:
The Agilent OpenLAB ECM Software and Hardware Requirements document states that the ECM client
requires the following OS:
"English US or Western European. English US is recommended for client machines running Schedulers or
any add-ons that generate XML data or perform filtering."
One might question what "Western European" includes.
Resolution or Recommendation:
It appears that ECM 3.5 with Internet Explorer 11 can be run on Windows 7 FR.
If you need the IE configuration settings in English you can use the following commands: (this technique may
also be helpful in comparing one operational IE configuration against another)
Registry keys for IE exported to capture configuration:? from elevated command prompt
reg export "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer" ie_hkcu.txt
reg export "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer" ie_hklm.txt
See attached.

KB0911171326
ECM 3.5
General Description/Summary:
The Agilent OpenLAB ECM Software and Hardware Requirements document states that the ECM client
requires the following OS:
"English US or Western European. English US is recommended for client machines running Schedulers or
any add-ons that generate XML data or perform filtering."
One might question what "Western European" includes.
Resolution or Recommendation:
It appears that ECM 3.5 with Internet Explorer 11 can be run on Windows 7 FR.
If you need the IE configuration settings in English you can use the following commands: (this technique may
also be helpful in comparing one operational IE configuration against another)
Registry keys for IE exported to capture configuration:? from elevated command prompt
reg export "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer" ie_hkcu.txt
reg export "HKLM\Software\Microsoft\Internet Explorer" ie_hklm.txt
See attached.

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

2025-06-07 15:53:46,492 - INFO - Message 1 - Role: system
2025-06-07 15:53:46,492 - INFO - Content: ### Task:

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

The Agilent OpenLAB ECM Software and Hardware Requirements document states that the ECM client
requires the following OS:

If you need the IE configuration settings in English you can use the following commands: (this technique may
also be helpful in comparing one operational IE configuration against another)

2025-06-07 15:54:10,295 - INFO - ### Task:

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

Created by TAKAYAMA,KIM (Agilent USA), last modified on Dec 22, 2021 
OpenLab BPM – What is LOB_TS
KB1015211533
Product Version: BPM 3.6

General Description/Summary:
Database scripts for BPM create and migration make references to a LOB_TS tablespace. What is this?

Resolution or Recommendation:
LOB_TS references are in both the BPMOracleCreate.sql and BPMOracleUpdate341_360.sql scripts and 
are referenced in the table creation SQL where LOBs are in the table definition.

The BPM 3.4.1 BPMOracleCreate.sql also uses the same syntax, so this is nothing new to BPM 3.6.

If logged into the instance as the ECM schema user and you do the following query:
SELECT * FROM USER_JOBS;  
This will list the COLUMN_NAME that is a LOB and the TABLESPACE_NAME where it is located. On an 
Agilent test VM, the BPM-related LOBs are all in tablespace ECM_DATA.

If the question is about having a tablespace associated only with the LOB objects, it appears these are 
part of the existing ECM tablespaces.

2025-06-07 15:54:23,417 - INFO - Message 1 - Role: system
2025-06-07 15:54:23,417 - INFO - Content: ### Task:

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:

    Provide a clear and direct response to the user's query, including inline citations in the format [id] only when the <source> tag with id attribute is present in the context.

<source id="1">OpenLab BPM – What is LOB_TS
Created by TAKAYAMA,KIM (Agilent USA), last modified on Dec 22, 2021 
OpenLab BPM – What is LOB_TS
KB1015211533
Product Version: BPM 3.6

General Description/Summary:
Database scripts for BPM create and migration make references to a LOB_TS tablespace. What is this?

Resolution or Recommendation:
LOB_TS references are in both the BPMOracleCreate.sql and BPMOracleUpdate341_360.sql scripts and 
are referenced in the table creation SQL where LOBs are in the table definition.

The BPM 3.4.1 BPMOracleCreate.sql also uses the same syntax, so this is nothing new to BPM 3.6.

If logged into the instance as the ECM schema user and you do the following query:
SELECT * FROM USER_JOBS;  
This will list the COLUMN_NAME that is a LOB and the TABLESPACE_NAME where it is located. On an 
Agilent test VM, the BPM-related LOBs are all in tablespace ECM_DATA.

If the question is about having a tablespace associated only with the LOB objects, it appears these are 
part of the existing ECM tablespaces.

Author: K.Takayama
Reference Ticket ID: SID-47849

Keywords: blob, clob, large object

Created by TAKAYAMA,KIM (Agilent USA), last modified on Dec 22, 2021 
OpenLab BPM – What is LOB_TS
KB1015211533
Product Version: BPM 3.6

General Description/Summary:
Database scripts for BPM create and migration make references to a LOB_TS tablespace. What is this?

Resolution or Recommendation:
LOB_TS references are in both the BPMOracleCreate.sql and BPMOracleUpdate341_360.sql scripts and 
are referenced in the table creation SQL where LOBs are in the table definition.

The BPM 3.4.1 BPMOracleCreate.sql also uses the same syntax, so this is nothing new to BPM 3.6.

If logged into the instance as the ECM schema user and you do the following query:
SELECT * FROM USER_JOBS;  
This will list the COLUMN_NAME that is a LOB and the TABLESPACE_NAME where it is located. On an 
Agilent test VM, the BPM-related LOBs are all in tablespace ECM_DATA.

If the question is about having a tablespace associated only with the LOB objects, it appears these are 
part of the existing ECM tablespaces.

2025-06-07 16:11:10,257 - INFO - Content: ### Task:

    Respond to the user query using the provided context, incorporating inline citations in the format [id] **only when the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute** (e.g., <source id="1">).
    
    ### Guidelines:

    - If you don't know the answer, clearly state that.
    - If uncertain, ask the user for clarification.
    - Respond in the same language as the user's query.
    - If the context is unreadable or of poor quality, inform the user and provide the best possible answer.
    - If the answer isn't present in the context but you possess the knowledge, explain this to the user and provide the answer using your own understanding.
    - **Only include inline citations using [id] (e.g., [1], [2]) when the <source> tag includes an id attribute.**
    - Do not cite if the <source> tag does not contain an id attribute.
    - Do not use XML tags in your response.
    - Ensure citations are concise and directly related to the information provided.
    
    ### Example of Citation:

    If the user asks about a specific topic and the information is found in a source with a provided id attribute, the response should include the citation like in the following example:

    * "According to the study, the proposed method increases efficiency by 20% [1]."
    
    ### Output:
