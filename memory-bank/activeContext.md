# Active Context: RAG Assistant Interface

## Current Work Focus
We are currently working on fixing UI issues with the evaluation display in the RAG Assistant Interface. While the evaluation data is being correctly passed to the network tab in the query call, it wasn't showing up in the UI.

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed the method mismatch issue by implementing the missing `query` method in the rag_assistant.py file. This method serves as a wrapper around the existing `generate_rag_response` method and is called by app.py.
2. Updated the Azure OpenAI deployment names in the .env file to use the actual deployment names available on the Azure OpenAI service:
   - Changed `EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT` back to `embedding01`
   - Changed `CHAT_DEPLOYMENT` back to `deployment02`
   - Changed `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL` back to `deployment02`
   - Changed `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_NAME` back to `embedding01`
3. Fixed the evaluation display issue in the frontend by:
   - Consolidating multiple conflicting implementations of the `displayEvaluation()` function in index.html
   - Updating the function to properly parse and display the evaluation data
   - Adding regex pattern matching to extract metrics from the evaluation markdown
   - Ensuring the function uses the correct HTML element IDs that exist in the document

## Next Steps
1. Continue testing the application to ensure all features work correctly
2. Improve error handling and logging
3. Add more comprehensive documentation
4. Consider implementing user feedback collection and analysis
5. Explore adding support for streaming responses

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### Frontend Issues
- The evaluation data is being correctly generated by the backend but wasn't displaying properly in the UI
- Multiple conflicting implementations of the `displayEvaluation()` function in the JavaScript code were causing issues
- The final implementation was trying to access an element with ID 'overall-assessment' which doesn't exist in the HTML
- We've consolidated the function implementations and improved the parsing of evaluation data

### Error Handling
- The application should provide more informative error messages when API calls fail
- We should implement better logging to help diagnose issues in the future
- Error messages should be user-friendly and provide clear guidance on how to resolve issues

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Management
- The application uses environment variables loaded from a `.env` file for configuration
- Sensitive information like API keys should be kept in the `.env` file and not committed to version control

### Error Handling
- Errors should be caught, logged, and presented to the user in a friendly manner
- The application should degrade gracefully when external services are unavailable

### Code Organization
- The application follows a modular structure with separate files for different components
- The RAG assistant functionality is encapsulated in its own class for reusability

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Azure OpenAI Integration
- Azure OpenAI requires properly configured deployments for both embeddings and chat completions
- The deployment names must be specified in the configuration and must match existing deployments in the Azure OpenAI service
- The API version is important and must be compatible with the features being used

### RAG Pattern Implementation
- The application implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern
- User queries are converted to embeddings, which are used to search for relevant documents
- Retrieved documents are used as context for the language model to generate responses
- The quality of responses depends on both the retrieval and generation components

### Frontend Development
- JavaScript function overriding can cause subtle bugs when multiple implementations of the same function exist
- Regular expressions are useful for extracting structured data from markdown or text responses
- It's important to ensure that element IDs referenced in JavaScript actually exist in the HTML
- Console logging is helpful for debugging data flow issues between backend and frontend
