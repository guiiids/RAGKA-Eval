# Active Context: RAG Assistant Interface

## Current Work Focus
We are currently troubleshooting an error with the Azure OpenAI API deployment. The application is encountering a 404 "DeploymentNotFound" error when trying to use the Azure OpenAI service. This suggests that the deployment specified in the configuration doesn't exist or isn't properly set up.

## Recent Changes
1. Fixed the method mismatch issue by implementing the missing `query` method in the rag_assistant.py file. This method serves as a wrapper around the existing `generate_rag_response` method and is called by app.py.
2. Updated the Azure OpenAI deployment names in the .env file to use the actual deployment names available on the Azure OpenAI service:
   - Changed `EMBEDDING_DEPLOYMENT` back to `embedding01`
   - Changed `CHAT_DEPLOYMENT` back to `deployment02`
   - Changed `AZURE_OPENAI_MODEL` back to `deployment02`
   - Changed `AZURE_OPENAI_EMBEDDING_NAME` back to `embedding01`

## Next Steps
1. Diagnose the specific cause of the OpenAI API deployment error
2. Fix the configuration or deployment issues
3. Test the application to ensure it works correctly
4. Document the solution for future reference

## Active Decisions and Considerations

### API Configuration
- We need to verify that the Azure OpenAI endpoint, API key, and deployment names in the `.env` file are correct
- We should check if the deployments specified in the configuration actually exist in the Azure OpenAI service
- We may need to create new deployments or update the configuration to use existing ones

### Code Issues
- There appears to be a mismatch between the app.py and rag_assistant.py files
- The app.py file calls a `query` method on the `rag_assistant` object, but this method doesn't exist in the rag_assistant.py file
- We need to either implement the missing method or update app.py to use the existing methods

### Error Handling
- The application should provide more informative error messages when Azure OpenAI API calls fail
- We should implement better logging to help diagnose issues in the future

## Important Patterns and Preferences

### Configuration Management
- The application uses environment variables loaded from a `.env` file for configuration
- Sensitive information like API keys should be kept in the `.env` file and not committed to version control

### Error Handling
- Errors should be caught, logged, and presented to the user in a friendly manner
- The application should degrade gracefully when external services are unavailable

### Code Organization
- The application follows a modular structure with separate files for different components
- The RAG assistant functionality is encapsulated in its own class for reusability

## Learnings and Project Insights

### Azure OpenAI Integration
- Azure OpenAI requires properly configured deployments for both embeddings and chat completions
- The deployment names must be specified in the configuration and must match existing deployments in the Azure OpenAI service
- The API version is important and must be compatible with the features being used

### RAG Pattern Implementation
- The application implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern
- User queries are converted to embeddings, which are used to search for relevant documents
- Retrieved documents are used as context for the language model to generate responses
- The quality of responses depends on both the retrieval and generation components
