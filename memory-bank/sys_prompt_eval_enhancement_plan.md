## Prompt Evaluation Report

### Overall Assessment

The provided prompt (@/.sys_prompt_eval) is clear, comprehensive, and robust. It effectively sets the stage for a detailed evaluation of a RAG-based chatbot system prompt by clearly defining the evaluator's role, offering explicit examples, and presenting a clear evaluation framework. However, minor improvements in formatting consistency and explicit instructions about handling insufficient context scenarios could enhance its clarity and practical usability.

### Detailed Analysis

#### 1. **Clarity & Scope**

* **Strengths**:

  * Clearly identifies evaluator role: Lead AI System Architect.
  * Precisely states goal: diagnosing the prompt rather than a single response.
  * Clearly defines required components (User\_Query, Retrieved\_Context, Bot\_Response, Bot\_Instructions).

* **Areas for Improvement**:

  * Clarify explicitly how evaluators should handle cases when retrieved context is insufficient or irrelevant. Adding explicit instructions for evaluators to state clearly if the retrieved context lacks required information would enhance robustness.

#### 2. **Structure & Formatting**

* **Strengths**:

  * Good use of markdown headers, bullet points, and preformatted code blocks.
  * Structured example (Gold Standard Evaluation) provided is detailed and clearly illustrates expected output.

* **Areas for Improvement**:

  * Consistency could be improved: some areas mix bullets and numbered lists. A more consistent list style would improve readability.
  * Clarify explicitly if evaluators should directly copy formatting from the provided example or if slight deviations for clarity are acceptable.

#### 3. **Gold Standard Example Quality**

* **Strengths**:

  * Excellent example of detailed analysis covering adherence, accuracy, clarity, and recommendations.
  * Clearly identifies potential disconnects between queries, contexts, and responses.

* **Areas for Improvement**:

  * The example could explicitly state how evaluators should reference or handle confusing elements (e.g., references or footnotes). For instance, explicitly advising evaluators to flag unclear references like "\[1]" directly in their feedback.

#### 4. **Actionability**

* **Strengths**:

  * Clearly states that the goal is actionable feedback to developers on improving the system prompt.
  * Provides a robust framework and clear structure for how evaluators should deliver feedback.

* **Areas for Improvement**:

  * Clarify explicitly that evaluators must recommend specific corrective actions when the bot instructions fail to produce accurate responses due to context insufficiency, misinterpretation, or semantic errors. Currently implied but not explicitly emphasized.

### Conclusion & Recommendations for Improvement

The prompt is strong, clearly defined, and highly usable as-is. To refine it further and ensure maximum effectiveness:

1. **Explicit Handling Instructions**: Add specific guidelines instructing evaluators on how to report insufficient or irrelevant retrieved context.

2. **Consistency in Formatting**: Maintain consistent use of numbered and bulleted lists to clearly differentiate between sequential processes and non-ordered items.

3. **Enhanced Clarity on Actionable Feedback**: Explicitly state evaluators must provide concrete, actionable suggestions when deficiencies are found.

**Recommended Example Adjustment**:

> “If the Retrieved\_Context provided does not address the user's actual query, explicitly state this gap at the start of your evaluation, and clearly differentiate your feedback about content limitations from feedback about the quality of the Bot\_Response itself.”

With these minor adjustments, your evaluation prompt will achieve exceptional clarity, robustness, and effectiveness in practice.
