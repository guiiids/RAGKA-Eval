# System Patterns: RAG Assistant Interface

## System Architecture
The RAG Assistant Interface follows a client-server architecture with the following components:

1. **Frontend**: A responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface that allows users to interact with the system.
2. **Backend API**: A Flask application that handles requests from the frontend and communicates with Azure services.
3. **RAG Assistant**: A Python module that implements the Retrieval-Augmented Generation pattern.
4. **Azure OpenAI Service**: Provides embeddings and language model capabilities.
5. **Azure Cognitive Search**: Stores and retrieves knowledge base content.

## Key Technical Decisions

### 1. Flask Web Framework
- **Decision**: Use Flask for the backend API.
- **Rationale**: Lightweight, easy to integrate with Python AI libraries, and suitable for the application's needs.

### 2. Azure OpenAI Integration
- **Decision**: Use Azure OpenAI for embeddings and language model capabilities.
- **Rationale**: Provides enterprise-grade security, compliance, and scalability for AI workloads.

### 3. Azure Cognitive Search
- **Decision**: Use Azure Cognitive Search for knowledge retrieval.
- **Rationale**: Offers vector search capabilities, integrates well with Azure ecosystem, and provides scalable search functionality.

### 4. Environment-Based Configuration
- **Decision**: Use .env files for configuration management.
- **Rationale**: Keeps sensitive information out of source control and allows for easy configuration changes across environments.

## Design Patterns

### 1. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)
The core pattern of the application, where:
1. User queries are converted to embeddings
2. Relevant documents are retrieved from the knowledge base
3. Retrieved documents are used as context for the language model
4. The language model generates a response based on the query and context

### 2. Factory Pattern
Used in the RAG assistant to create appropriate clients for Azure services based on configuration.

### 3. Strategy Pattern
Applied in the evaluation component, allowing different evaluation strategies to be used for assessing response quality.

### 4. Observer Pattern
Implemented in the frontend to update the UI in response to changes in the application state.

## Component Relationships

### Frontend to Backend
- Frontend sends queries and configuration parameters to the backend API
- Backend returns responses, sources, and evaluation metrics

### Backend to RAG Assistant
- Backend passes queries and parameters to the RAG Assistant
- RAG Assistant returns generated responses and metadata

### RAG Assistant to Azure Services
- RAG Assistant sends embedding requests to Azure OpenAI
- RAG Assistant sends search queries to Azure Cognitive Search
- RAG Assistant sends completion requests to Azure OpenAI

## Critical Implementation Paths

### Query Processing Path
1. User submits query via frontend
2. Flask API receives query and parameters
3. RAG Assistant generates embeddings for the query
4. RAG Assistant searches for relevant documents
5. RAG Assistant prepares context from retrieved documents
6. RAG Assistant generates response using Azure OpenAI
7. RAG Assistant evaluates response quality
8. Flask API returns response, sources, and evaluation to frontend
9. Frontend displays results to user

### Error Handling Path
1. Error occurs in any component
2. Error is logged with appropriate context
3. User-friendly error message is generated
4. Error is returned to frontend
5. Frontend displays error message to user
