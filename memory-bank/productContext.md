# Product Context: RAG Assistant Interface

## Purpose
The RAG Assistant Interface serves as a bridge between users and a knowledge base, allowing them to query complex information using natural language. By combining the power of Azure OpenAI's language models with Azure Cognitive Search's retrieval capabilities, the application provides accurate, contextually relevant responses to user queries.

## Problems Solved
1. **Knowledge Access**: Makes it easy for users to access information from large knowledge bases without needing to know specific search terms or document locations.
2. **Context-Aware Responses**: Provides responses that take into account the context of the query and relevant information from the knowledge base.
3. **Source Transparency**: Shows users the sources used to generate responses, increasing trust and allowing for verification.
4. **Quality Assessment**: Evaluates the quality of responses in real-time, helping users gauge the reliability of the information.

## User Experience Goals
1. **Simplicity**: Provide a clean, intuitive interface that requires minimal training to use.
2. **Configurability**: Allow users to adjust model parameters to suit their specific needs.
3. **Responsiveness**: Ensure quick response times and feedback during processing.
4. **Transparency**: Make it clear how responses are generated and what sources are used.
5. **Reliability**: Handle errors gracefully and provide clear feedback when issues occur.

## Target Users
1. **Knowledge Workers**: Professionals who need to quickly access and synthesize information from large knowledge bases.
2. **Researchers**: Individuals looking to explore and extract insights from collections of documents.
3. **Support Staff**: Teams that need to provide accurate information to customers or colleagues.
4. **Content Creators**: Writers and creators who need to research topics and verify information.

## Integration Points
1. **Azure OpenAI**: For generating embeddings and responses.
2. **Azure Cognitive Search**: For storing and retrieving knowledge base content.
3. **Web Browsers**: The primary interface for users to interact with the application.

## Success Metrics
1. **Response Accuracy**: How accurately the system answers user queries.
2. **Response Time**: How quickly the system generates responses.
3. **User Satisfaction**: How satisfied users are with the interface and responses.
4. **Source Relevance**: How relevant the retrieved sources are to the user's query.
