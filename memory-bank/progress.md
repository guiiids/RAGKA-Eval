# Progress: RAG Assistant Interface

## What Works
- The project structure is set up with the necessary files
- The configuration system using environment variables is in place
- The RAG assistant class is implemented with methods for generating embeddings, searching the knowledge base, and generating responses
- The Flask API is set up with endpoints for querying the assistant and evaluating responses
- The frontend interface is implemented with cards for model parameters, output, and evaluation
- The evaluation data is now properly displayed in the UI, with metrics extracted from the markdown response

## What's Left to Build
- Continue testing the application to ensure all features work correctly
- Improve error handling and logging
- Add more comprehensive documentation
- Implement user feedback collection and analysis
- Add support for streaming responses

## Current Status
The application is now functional. We've fixed the evaluation display issue in the frontend, and the application is able to process queries and display responses with proper evaluation metrics.

## Known Issues
1. **OpenAI API Deployment Error**: FIXED - We've resolved the connection issues with the Azure OpenAI deployment by using the correct deployment names.
2. **Method Mismatch**: FIXED - We've implemented the missing `query` method in the rag_assistant.py file.
3. **Evaluation Display**: FIXED - We've fixed the issue with evaluation data not displaying in the UI by consolidating the displayEvaluation function and properly parsing the evaluation data.
4. **Error Handling**: The application doesn't provide user-friendly error messages for all error cases.
5. **Documentation**: The documentation is incomplete, particularly regarding deployment and troubleshooting.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Design
- The project was designed to use Azure OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search for implementing a RAG pattern
- The application was structured with a Flask backend and a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript frontend
- Configuration was managed using environment variables loaded from a .env file

### Current Approach
- We are maintaining the same overall architecture while fixing frontend and backend issues
- We've improved the frontend code to better handle the evaluation data structure
- We're using regex pattern matching to extract structured data from markdown responses
- We're adding better error handling and logging to make troubleshooting easier in the future

### Future Considerations
- We may want to add support for multiple Azure OpenAI deployments to provide fallbacks
- We could implement caching to improve performance and reduce API calls
- We might want to add authentication to protect the API endpoints
- We could enhance the frontend with more interactive features and visualizations
- We should consider implementing a more structured evaluation response format to avoid having to parse markdown
