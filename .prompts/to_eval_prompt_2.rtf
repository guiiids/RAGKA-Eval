To add a new fund to a lab, navigate to the "Manually Add a Fund Number" section of the tab. Here are the steps you need to follow:\
\
1. If your institution supports this feature, use the interface provided to request access to additional funds.\
2. Type the new fund number in the correct format into the designated field and click "Add".\
3. For certain institutions, adding a fund may require additional approval from the fund owner. In such cases, you will receive a notification once the fund has been approved.\
4. If approval is not required, after clicking "Add", the screen will refresh and the new fund number will be added to your Fund Grid.\
5. The newly added fund is now available for assignment to group members [helpjuice_articles_simple].\
\
Please note that if your institution requires additional approvals before using new funds, these must be obtained before they can be actively used in transactions [helpjuice_articles_simple].\
