- **Timestamp**: 2025-06-09 12:08:18
- **Model**: gpt-4o

## Query
```
How to add a new fund to a lab?
```

## System Prompt
```
### Task:

Respond to the user query using ONLY the provided context.

### Guidelines:

- **Paraphrasing:** Paraphrase the user's question to show understanding.
- **Citations:** Use inline citations in the format [id] only if the <source> tag includes an explicit id attribute (e.g., <source id="1">). If source IDs are not present, clearly state that citations are not possible due to missing source IDsâ€”do not invent them.
- **Context Sufficiency:** If the provided context is insufficient to fully answer the query, notify the user directly. Do NOT use outside knowledge or supplement with external information.
- **Clarification:** If context is unclear or incomplete, prompt the user for clarification or additional details instead of guessing or assuming.
- **Role-Specificity:** Focus only on information explicitly available in the provided context. Do not extrapolate, speculate, or assume role-based details that are not directly stated.
- If you don't know the answer based on context, clearly say so.
- Respond in the same language as the query.
- If the context is unreadable or malformed, notify the user and stop.

## Response
```
To add a new fund to a lab, navigate to the "Manually Add a Fund Number" section of the tab. Here are the steps you need to follow:

1. If your institution supports this feature, use the interface provided to request access to additional funds.
2. Type the new fund number in the correct format into the designated field and click "Add".
3. For certain institutions, adding a fund may require additional approval from the fund owner. In such cases, you will receive a notification once the fund has been approved.
4. If approval is not required, after clicking "Add", the screen will refresh and the new fund number will be added to your Fund Grid.
5. The newly added fund is now available for assignment to group members [helpjuice_articles_simple].

Please note that if your institution requires additional approvals before using new funds, these must be obtained before they can be actively used in transactions [helpjuice_articles_simple].

## Suggestions

Context Sufficiency Notification:  

Modify the System Prompt to ensure the bot explicitly informs the user when the Retrieved_Context is insufficient to answer the query. This should be prioritized over attempting to provide a complete answer.


Strict Adherence to Context:  

Reinforce the instruction that the bot should not extrapolate or use external information when the context is lacking. This can be achieved by adding a rule that emphasizes the importance of context fidelity.


User Guidance for Insufficient Context:  

Include a guideline for the bot to suggest the user seek additional information or clarification from relevant personnel (e.g., lab manager) when the context does not provide the necessary details.


Inline Citation Clarity:  

Ensure the bot understands when to use inline citations and when to state their absence due to missing source IDs, preventing any confusion about the origin of information.



By implementing these recommendations, the System Prompt can better guide the bot in delivering responses that are both accurate and contextually faithful, enhancing user trust and satisfaction.


## Full Evaluation
Evaluation Report
1. Overall Assessment

Strengths: The Bot_Response attempts to provide a step-by-step guide, which aligns with the instructional nature of the User_Query. It also includes a note about potential approval requirements, which is a useful consideration for the user.
Weaknesses: The Retrieved_Context does not contain sufficient information to fully address the User_Query. The Bot_Response includes steps and details that are not supported by the Retrieved_Context, indicating a deviation from the Bot_Instructions.

2. Detailed Analysis
1. Adherence to Instructions

The Bot_Response does not fully adhere to the Bot_Instructions. While it provides a step-by-step guide, it fails to notify the user that the Retrieved_Context is insufficient to answer the User_Query. The Bot_Instructions explicitly state that the bot should notify the user when context is insufficient and refrain from using external information.

2. Content Accuracy & Faithfulness

Insufficient Context: The Retrieved_Context does not contain information on how to add a new fund to a lab. It mentions filtering funds, manually adding fund numbers, and fund assignment, but lacks specific steps or procedures for adding a new fund.
The Bot_Response includes steps that are not found in the Retrieved_Context, such as navigating to a specific section and typing a fund number, which suggests the use of external knowledge or assumptions.

3. Clarity & Readability

The Bot_Response is organized and clear, providing a logical sequence of steps. However, the inclusion of unsupported details may confuse the user, as these steps are not verifiable within the provided context.

3. Actionable Recommendations
