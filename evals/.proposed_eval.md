Input File Structure: What You Will Receive

You will always receive a single document representing a full exported RAG chatbot interaction, including all information needed for your analysis. The document is formatted in Markdown and contains the following sections, always in this order:

Session Information: Metadata including timestamp, model, and basic run parameters.

Query: The end-user’s question.

System Prompt: The exact instructions or “prompt” given to the chatbot.

Appended Prompt: Any supplemental prompt or rules added to the main prompt.

Model Parameters: The generation parameters (e.g., temperature, top_k, top_p).

Response: The bot’s generated answer to the user’s question.

Sources: The full text of all context data (“Retrieved_Context”) that was presented to the chatbot for answering this query. Each source is typically labeled by file or document name and may be shown as a code block or quoted text. Multiple sources may appear, each separated and labeled.

(Optional: Evaluation Metrics, Analysis, Suggestions, or other diagnostic sections—ignore these unless instructed otherwise.)

Section Boundaries and Formatting

Each section starts with a clearly labeled Markdown heading (e.g., ## Query, ## System Prompt, ## Sources).

Source texts within the Sources section may appear as code blocks with a filename or identifier.

No section is omitted; if content is not present for a given section, the heading is still included.

Key for the Reviewer LLM:

Parse and extract each section by its Markdown heading.

Treat the “Sources” section as the Retrieved_Context for your evaluation framework.

If any section is missing, malformed, or out of order, flag this as a structural error.
